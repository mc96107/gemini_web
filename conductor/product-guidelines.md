# Product Guidelines - Gemini Termux Agent

## Tone and Voice
* **Professional and Technical:** The agent communicates with precision and conciseness. It uses technical terminology accurately and focuses on providing direct, actionable information suitable for power users and developers.

## Visual Identity and UI Patterns
* **Terminal-Inspired Consistency:** The user interface maintains a consistent aesthetic that mirrors terminal environments. This includes the use of monospaced fonts for code and system outputs, a high-contrast dark color palette, and a focus on text-based interaction.

## Security and Privacy Principles
* **Transparent Authentication:** The application provides clear visual feedback regarding the authentication status. Users are explicitly informed when they are authenticated via Passkeys, Ethereum signatures, or other methods, ensuring a high level of trust and clarity.

## Content Organization and Formatting
* **Structured Information Delivery:** To manage complex data, the agent utilizes structured Markdown formatting. This includes headers for organization, bulleted and numbered lists for readability, and clearly delineated code blocks for technical snippets, ensuring that information is easily digestible.
