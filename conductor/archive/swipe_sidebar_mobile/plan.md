- [x] Research touch event handling for swipes.

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [x] Add touch event listeners to the document or main container in `app/static/script.js`.
- [x] Calculate swipe direction and distance.
- [x] Trigger sidebar toggle based on swipe.

## Phase 3: Verification
- [x] Test on mobile emulator and physical devices if possible.
