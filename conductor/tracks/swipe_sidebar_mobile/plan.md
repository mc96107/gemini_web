# Implementation Plan: Reveal sidebar on swipe left to right

## Phase 1: Research
- Check existing sidebar implementation in `app/templates/index.html` and `app/static/script.js`.
- Research touch event handling for swipes.

## Phase 2: Implementation
- Add touch event listeners to the document or main container in `app/static/script.js`.
- Calculate swipe direction and distance.
- Trigger sidebar toggle based on swipe.

## Phase 3: Verification
- Test on mobile emulator and physical devices if possible.
